This notebook walks through the steps to create Sankey diagram of a confusion matrix. It also contains a function that can be applied to any confusion matrix to plot it as Sankey diagram.

## Why Sankey chart is useful to visualise confusion matrix?
While communicating with non-technical stakeholders, confusion matrix is not intuitive visual to explain machine learning model performance. 
Sankey chart will make it simple to explain the model performance using how instances flow from true classes to predicted classes as depicted below.
